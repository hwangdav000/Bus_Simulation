//  TESTS DONE FOR CONFIG SIM
RUN GRACEFULLY = RUNS DEFAULT IF ERROR OCCURS

COMMAND LINE ARGS (what user provides)
/configuration_sim config_txt length_of_sim start_time_of_initial_bus

POTENTIAL ERRORS(OR ARG EXCLUSION) RESULTS IN CONFIG COMMAND LINE
CONFIG TEXT
1. config.txt not specified
  - if config.txt is missing
  Ex: user only runs executable
  Res: RUNS config.txt printing error message
2. config.txt is not correct
  - Assuming that all .txt files in config folder are CORRECT
  - if config.txt is not found in config folder
  Ex: user does not provide config.txt that could be found in config
  Res: runs default printing error message
LENGTH_OF_SIM (provides length of config_sim)
1. If length_of_sim NOT provided
  Ex: user only provides exec and config.txt
  Res: Config Sim runs with default length_of_sim 50
2. If length of sim is not numerical
  Ex: user provides "ab" for length of sim
  Res: Config sim run default with Sim printing error message
START TIME OF INITIAL BUS
1. if NOT provided
  Ex: user only provides exec, config.txt, length_of_sim
  Res: Config sim runs with default start time of 10 for initial bus
2. If start time is not numerical
  Ex: user provides "ab" for start time
  Res: Runs default of 10 from config sim printing error message
OTHER POTENTIAL ERRORS
1. User provides more than 4 arguments
  Ex: User provides more than arguments specified
  Res: Runs default from config sim and prints out error message
- CONFIG SIM will print out any errors that occur in command line above
  Ex: have over 4 arguments and length of bus is "ab"
  Res: Prints default and prints out the error message of length of bus and over
  4 arguments provided

  - Only if missing config.txt will error be printed out rather than any other
  txt is because config text is important to running the program and will alert
  user that they have not provided their data  that they can run.
